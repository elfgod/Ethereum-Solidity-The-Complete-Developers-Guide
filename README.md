### Description

Smart Contracts? They're here. The Ethereum Blockchain? Covered. Solidity? Yep!

There can be no understating it: Ethereum and Blockchain technology is the most disruptive force in years. Companies cannot hire developers who understand blockchain technologies fast enough, but there are a tiny number of resources published to help you truly understand what blockchains are used for, let alone build apps with them. That's the purpose of this course: to be the best resource online for learning about Ethereum, blockchains, and how to build apps with this new technology.

The development community is still figuring out the best way to use Ethereum in the creation of new and exciting apps. I spent a tremendous amount of time to research and create best practice for interfacing with Ethereum from Javascript. I can't overstate it enough; this course will show you the best and most easily repeatable patterns for creating production-ready apps with Ethereum.

What tools and libraries are used?

The Ethereum tech ecosystem is in constant change. Don't be fooled by other courses that mention how you'll learn a dozen different libraries! Every library that you'll use with Ethereum breaks and is deprecated on a near-weekly basis! Instead, this course will teach you how to assemble your own boilerplate package to develop, compile, and test Smart Contracts. By learning the core technologies, you'll be prepared to adjust to Ethereum no matter how the ecosystem changes.

What is Ethereum?

Ethereum is a cryptocurrency much like Bitcoin, and it has been heralded as Bitcoins successor. Whereas Bitcoin currently has issues scaling with an increasing backlog of transactions, Ethereum is poised to surpass Bitcoin in performance, popularity, and value. Ethereum was created to help developers like you create applications focused around transferring money or value from one party to another.

What is Solidity?

Solidity is a programming language for writing Smart Contracts. Essentially, think of it as a way to control a bank account with code. With Solidity, we can write applications that simulate a crowd funding campaign, a lottery, a loan, or any other type of financial instrument. Don't be intimidated by learning 'another' programming language; Solidity is known to be quite similar to Javascript and exceptionally easy to pick up for anyone who has previous JS experience. This course will give you all the tools you need to master Solidity.

### Who this course is for:

- Programmers looking to leverage blockchain technology for advanced apps
- Engineers who want to understand Ethereum and how to build apps with it

### Requirements

### 3. Metamask Setup

1. Setup the metamask extension sign up and follow the instructions
2. Click Ethereum Mainnet and select Show/Hide test networks
3. Toggle the Show test networks button to ON (You can now change between networks now)

### 4. A Note About the Faucet

In the upcoming lecture, we will be heading to https://rinkeby-faucet.com for a quick demo to receive .001 Ether.

This particular faucet sources Ether from the official Rinkeby Authenticated Faucet. Due to the very high demand and interest in Ethereum, the official faucet will frequently stop funding requests. Once this occurs our demo faucet will quickly run out of Ether and you may receive an Insufficient Funds error.

If you encounter any errors please use the following faucet instead:  
https://faucets.chain.link/rinkeby

1. Make sure you are signed into Metamask in your browser, and the Rinkeby Test Network is selected:
2. Click the Connect wallet button in the top right corner of the page:
3. Check the I'm not a robot verification
4. Click Send request (Important - You'll probably want to make three requests to get at least 0.3 Ether to use in the course. You can always come back for more if you need)
